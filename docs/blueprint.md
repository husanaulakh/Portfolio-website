## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Near-black (#030803) providing a dark backdrop that will contrast the text and focal elements and add some visual depth. The subtle tint comes from the primary color below.
- Primary color: Saturated green (#81FF53), which brings the vibrance from the prompt, and stays clear of clich√© choices while maintaining the correct design-historical reference for the art.
- Accent color: A vivid lime green (#B1FF53), creates emphasis and highlights important UI elements. Together, these color decisions will support both dark mode and an eye catching aesthetic.
- Serif headings, such as Playfair Display, paired with sans-serif body text like Inter, for clear hierarchy and readability.
- Use simple, outlined icons in neon green to match the accent color.
- Full-width pages with a 1200px max-width container for centered content and consistent spacing.
- Subtle animations on hover for navigation items and buttons, with scroll-triggered fade-ins for sections, to enhance user experience via Intersection Observer.
